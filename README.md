# Image-Classification-using-Neural-Nets-Keras-
A practice project for Deep Learning using <b>Keras</b> and <b>Tensorflow</b>. Here I trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images from the Tensorflow <i>"rock-paper-scissors"</i> dataset, which is a built-in dataset in Tensorflow.
## Network 1 (Basic Feed-forward Network)
The first neural network I trained was just a feed-forward network without any Convolutional layers. It managed to achieve an accuracy of 47.58%.

## Network 2 and 3 (Convolutional Neural Networks)
The second network is a very basic CNN approach, which managed to achieve an accuracy of 53.76%. <br>The third network is a slightly improved version of the previous network and it managed to achieve an accuracy score of 75.00%.

## Hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner
Keras Tuner is a tool that allows us to set some values for the hyperparameters, and the tool will automatically check all of the hyperparameter combinations and return the model with the highest accuracy. After using Keras Tuner, the accuracy of my model inceased to 80.64%.
